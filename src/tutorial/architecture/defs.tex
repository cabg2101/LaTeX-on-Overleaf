This folder contains \TeX{} files that defines new \glspl{macro}. Usually, they're used to create shortcuts for the document, such as \texttt{\textbackslash{}title} for the document title on the cover page. One can also create custom \gls{environment} or acronyms for words that are often used, although I would recommend the \texttt{glossaries} package if your words are technical and you would like to provide a list of acronyms and/or a glossary (see \S~\ref{sec:tutorial/latex/crossref/glossary}).
