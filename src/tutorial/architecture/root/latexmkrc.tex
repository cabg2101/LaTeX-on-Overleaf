If you've never seen it before, a \texttt{latexmk\glsdisp{RC}{rc}} file is a configuration / initialization file for the \texttt{Latexmk} package. \texttt{Latexmk} is used by Overleaf to control the compilation of your plain text files into the final typeset \gls{PDF} file. By using a customized configuration file called \texttt{Latexmk}, you can override the default compilation \glspl{command-prog} to allow Overleaf to compile your document in a special way \parencite{web:overleaf-latexmkrc}.

In our case, I'm using it to specify the default location of custom \glspl{package}, which is needed for the preamble (see \S~\ref{sec:tutorial/architecture/cmds} and \S~\ref{sec:tutorial/preamble/custom}), and the time zone for the \texttt{\textbackslash{}today} date \gls{command} in the cover page.
