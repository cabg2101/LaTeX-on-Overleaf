\noindent The main file only contains two commands:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{\textbackslash{}Require\Gls{package}\{import\}}, which makes sure that the \texttt{import} \gls{package} is available to add the content of other \TeX{} files;
    \item an import call to select the document to compile, in this case \texttt{tutorial.tex} inside the \texttt{src/} folder. This allows us to define documents in completely different ways, although we can only compile one at a time.
\end{itemize}
