\noindent In this project, we have two other files in the root folder:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{.gitattributes}, which makes sure that every Windows-specific line return (\tcbox{\texttt{CR}}\tcbox{\texttt{LF}}) gets converted to a UNIX-compliant line return (\tcbox{\texttt{CR}}) for every \TeX{} file (\texttt{.cls}, \texttt{.sty}, \texttt{.tex}, etc.). This is necessary because the \TeX{} processor doesn't manage non-UNIX line returns. Binary files are ignored;
    \item \texttt{README.MD}, which describes the project architecture on a GitHub mirror. The project is synced over GitHub to keep track of changes and save a copy in the advent of a major failure or an accidental wiping of files.
\end{itemize}
