\noindent Lists are a very simple \gls{environment}. You only need to know three \glspl{command}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{item}, to declare the elements of a list;
    \item \texttt{itemize}, the \gls{environment} for unordered lists;
    \item \texttt{enumerate}, the \gls{environment} for ordered lists.
\end{itemize}

That's all there is! If you need a list inside a list, you can nest your \gls{environment} instances as needed. In this project, bullets are defined for up to four levels. If you need more or you want to redefine the bullets, you can do so in the preamble (see \S~\ref{sec:tutorial/preamble/list}). For list examples, refer to \S~\ref{sec:tutorial/templates/list}.
