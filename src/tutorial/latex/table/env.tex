To overcome the difficulty of setting up a table, \textit{many} people created table \gls{package}. The most commonly used ones are listed in table \ref{tab:tutorial/latex/table/env}. I usually recommend using \texttt{longtable} so it can easily break over to the next page if necessary, though it doesn't reckon well with multi-column documents or stretching columns---columns that make sure the table is as wide as the text area. I am currently looking for a replacement that could alleviate those issues: the table sections in this document are subject to change.

\textbf{A word of warning:} Adding another \gls{environment}, such as \texttt{itemize}, inside a table is \textit{not recommended}, as it's not aware of a table's functions and \glspl{variable}. These \glspl{environment} define everything for themselves, and therefore are not compatible with other \glspl{environment}, except where compatibility was explicitly enabled (\texttt{figure} with \texttt{subfigure}, \texttt{equation} with \texttt{align}, etc.). To replace the functionality of a list, we can define a bullet point with the custom \gls{command} \texttt{\textbackslash{}tabitem} (see \S~\ref{sec:tutorial/latex/custom}). Some examples are available in \S~\ref{sec:tutorial/templates/table}.

For more documentation and examples about all types of tables, be sure to checkout \citename{book:voss-tables}{author}'s guide on table typesetting \parencite{book:voss-tables}. If you're not a fan of the \guil{prison} style of tables---which works very well for reports in my opinion, you can checkout \citename{web:guide-nice-tables}{author}'s guide on nice tables \parencite{web:guide-nice-tables}.
