The \texttt{xifthen} \gls{package} extends the functionality of the \texttt{ifthen} \gls{package} to allow for more complex tests of \glspl{conditional} (\gls{variable} declaration, equality of \glspl{variable}, find a void string, etc.). It is currently used in the cover page for reports, which checks if an author name is empty or not. If not, it is added to the cover page.
