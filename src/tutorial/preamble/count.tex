The first four lines reset the way counters are incremented per the requirement of the \citelist{report:udes-writing-guide}{institution}: equations, figures, listings, and tables must be counted within a section.

The last five lines define the appearance of the floating \gls{environment} \glspl{bookmark}. Most use the section \gls{bookmark} followed by their own counter \gls{value}, except for subfigures that simply use lowercase letters.
