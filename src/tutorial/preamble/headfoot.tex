The \texttt{fancyhdr} \gls{package} provides \glspl{macro} to customize the appearance and easily swap between styles of headers and footers. You can select one with \glspl{command} \texttt{\textbackslash{}thispagestyle} for a single page or \texttt{\textbackslash{}pagestyle} for the following pages. Standard styles include \texttt{empty}, \texttt{plain}, \texttt{headings}, and \texttt{myheadings}. You can also define custom styles (see \S~\ref{sec:tutorial/preamble/headfoot/style}).

The \texttt{lastpage} \gls{package} provides a \gls{command} to refer to the total number of pages of your document. This is currently used in the footer of this document.
