This is a custom header and footer style for my reports. We first start by resetting the default formatting with \texttt{\textbackslash{}fancyhf\{\}}. We can then declare anything we want inside the header or the footer with \texttt{\textbackslash{}fancyhead\{\}} or \texttt{\textbackslash{}fancyfoot\{\}} respectively. The \texttt{L}~/~\texttt{C}~/~\texttt{R} option sets the position (left, center, right). The \glspl{command} \texttt{\textbackslash{}leftmark} and \texttt{\textbackslash{}rightmark} \glsdisp{reference}{refer} to the top and bottom section levels respectively. The rulers \texttt{\textbackslash{}headrulewidth} and \texttt{\textbackslash{}footrulewidth} can be redefined or commented out if you want separators for your header and footer or not. Finally, the \gls{command} \texttt{\textbackslash{}fancyheadoffset\{\}} is reset to allow automatic adjustment of the header and footer when changing the geometry of the document (see \S~\ref{sec:tutorial/preamble/geometry}).
