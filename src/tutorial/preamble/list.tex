The \texttt{enumitem} \gls{package} controls the layout of list \glspl{environment}, such as \texttt{itemize}, \texttt{enumerate}, and \texttt{description}. We call it to modify the spacing between the item \gls{macro} the following content (lines 696--699) as well as changing the bullet points used (lines 700--705). The custom \gls{command} \texttt{\textbackslash{}newbullet} and the custom \gls{environment} \texttt{myitemize} are commented out since it's not necessary in our case to have a personalized bullet point.
