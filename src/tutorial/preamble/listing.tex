The \texttt{listings} \gls{package} provides utilities to typeset programs within \LaTeX. We can define programming languages or extend them (see \S~\ref{sec:tutorial/preamble/listing/style}), import code files, and label typeset chunks of code just like we would with figures, tables, and equations.
