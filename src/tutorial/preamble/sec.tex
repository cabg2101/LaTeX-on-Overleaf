The \texttt{titlesec} \gls{package} can be used to customize the appearance of section titles and \glspl{bookmark}. The first set of lines (669--671) is used to change the appearance of numbered section \glspl{bookmark}. The next set (673--676) redefines the section title formatting by modifying the font and the spacing after the \gls{bookmark}. The last set (678--681) specifies the left margin and the vertical spacing around section titles.
